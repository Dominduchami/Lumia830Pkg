# Lumia830Pkg
WIP Custom ARM UEFI firmware for Lumia 830
Based on Lumia830Pkg by rickliu : https://github.com/rickliu2000/Lumia830Pkg

# Current Status
Edk2 boots to EFI shell correctly, but bootmgfw.efi and displays this error : "ConvertPages : failed to find range 10000000 - 100EEFFF". Memory map still isn't entirely correct.
